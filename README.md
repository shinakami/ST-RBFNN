### Model Construction and Parameter Settings

Set `num_centers` as the number of RBF centers in the hidden layer, and define the hyperparameter `gamma` to control the spread of the RBF kernel. Select `num_centers` center points \(\{ c_1, c_2, \dots, c_{num\_centers} \}\), randomly chosen from the input samples \(X\).

### Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel Computation

For any input sample \(x_i\) and center point \(c_j\), the output of the RBF kernel function is:
\[
\phi(x_i, c_j) = \exp(-\gamma \| x_i - c_j \|^2)
\]
where \(\| x_i - c_j \|\) is the Euclidean distance between \(x_i\) and \(c_j\), and \(\gamma\) controls the spread or scale of the RBF.

### Construction of the Hidden Layer Output Matrix

For each input sample \(x_i\), compute its RBF kernel output to all center points, forming the hidden layer output matrix \(\Phi\), where:
\[
\Phi_{ij} = \phi(x_i, c_j) = \exp(-\gamma \| x_i - c_j \|^2)
\]
The size of this matrix is \(N \times num\_centers\), where \(N\) is the number of samples.

### Weight Calculation

The goal in the training phase is to find the optimal linear weights \(w\) so that the model's output closely matches the target values \(y\). The weights \(w\) can be solved using the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse:
\[
w = \Phi^+ y
\]
where \(\Phi^+\) is the pseudo-inverse of \(\Phi\), calculated as \(w = \text{pinv}(\Phi) \cdot y\).

### Prediction Phase

In the prediction phase, given a new input \(X_{new}\), first compute the new hidden layer output matrix \(\Phi_{new}\):
\[
\Phi_{new, ij} = \exp(-\gamma \| x_{new,i} - c_j \|^2)
\]
The predicted output \( \hat{y}_{new} \) can then be obtained through matrix multiplication:
\[
\hat{y}_{new} = \Phi_{new} w
\]

### Summary

The above outlines the mathematical flow of the model, including the construction of the RBF hidden layer, the calculation of weights, and the use of the RBF and learned weights for prediction.

### Code Suitability for Multi-dimensional Data

Yes, this code is suitable for multi-dimensional data, such as when each sample consists of multi-dimensional feature vectors (e.g., \(x\), \(y\), and \(t\)). In such cases, the code will calculate the RBF kernel output based on each sample's multi-dimensional features.

#### Details for Handling Multi-dimensional Data

1. **Input Feature Dimension**:
   - If \(x\), \(y\), and \(t\) are each two-dimensional, then each sample \(x_i\) will be a higher-dimensional feature vector. For instance, if \(x\), \(y\), and \(t\) are each two-dimensional, the total feature count for each sample will be \(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\) dimensions.
   - In the code, \(X\) is an \(N \times D\) matrix, where \(N\) is the number of samples and \(D\) is the feature dimension. The code will handle this \(D\) size correctly, regardless of whether it is single-dimensional or multi-dimensional data.

2. **Euclidean Distance Calculation**:
   - The `cdist` function in the `rbf_kernel` function works for vectors of any dimension, so it can calculate the Euclidean distance between multi-dimensional features:
     \[
     \text{distance}_{ij} = \| x_i - c_j \| = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{D} (x_{i,k} - c_{j,k})^2}
     \]
   - Here, \(x_i\) and \(c_j\) are \(D\)-dimensional vectors, so the distance calculation in the code will automatically adapt to multi-dimensional features.

3. **Model Adaptability**:
   - The `fit` and `predict` methods in `ST_RBFNN` work effectively for multi-dimensional features since they depend on the total feature count \(D\) rather than a specific structure. Thus, the code is suitable for any multi-dimensional data structure.

#### Conclusion
The RBF kernel function and distance calculation methods in the code are flexible enough to handle multi-dimensional feature data. As long as the multi-dimensional feature data is correctly formatted as an \(N \times D\) matrix, the model will work as expected, calculating outputs based on each sample's multi-dimensional features.
